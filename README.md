This is a coding project to learn HTML and CSS.  
Everything was started using information from provided materials.  
Further research was done with Medium articles on Flexbox.
Some refinement was done using LibertyGPT.  
UPDATE: Using the suggestions from GPT really hosed my page!  I reverted back to my orginal CSS, which is not very effecient.  I know that I could consolidate more but I've already spent too many hours doing so!
